# Injector

A simple and convenient mod loader for ProjectZomboid. It allows you to write modifications using Java, completely forgetting about Lua. The mod loader allows you to completely rewrite the existing functionality due to the fact that you can override existing classes, as well as create your own classes and build interaction between existing and new code


## Features

- Full support for Java-only development
- The ability to add functionality that requires high performance directly in C
- Full freedom for creativity due to the ability to rewrite and add new classes

## Roadmap

- .java files compilator to .class files
- .java to C compilator to provide high performance
- debugging features and support
- API to provide ability to interact with PZ code without spending a huge amount of time understanding the internals of PZ
- Clear documentation for loader internals and future API
